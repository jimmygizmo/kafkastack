UPDATE: This is still an open topic and I have only looked briefly at what dirs obviouly
contain changing runtime data. I've only mapped one from each container; the most obvious
ones. TODO: Fully research and analyze what dirs we really need to map for full persistence,
correct operation and good configuration. Mapping volumes seems like a way config can be
handled but I will first opt for copying config files in.
