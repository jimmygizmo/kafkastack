These are some nice descriptions/definitions taken from the following article:

Kafka — Basically an event streaming platform. It enables users to collect, store,
  and process data to build real-time event-driven applications. It’s written in
  Java and Scala, but you don’t have to know these to work with Kafka. There’s
  also a Python API.

Kafka broker — A single Kafka Cluster is made of Brokers. They handle producers
  and consumers and keeps data replicated in the cluster.

Kafka topic — A category to which records are published. Imagine you had a large
  news site — each news category could be a single Kafka topic.

Kafka producer — An application (a piece of code) you write to get data to Kafka.

Kafka consumer — A program you write to get data out of Kafka. Sometimes a
  consumer is also a producer, as it puts data elsewhere in Kafka.

Zookeeper — Used to manage a Kafka cluster, track node status, and maintain a
  list of topics and messages. Kafka version 2.8.0 introduced early access to
  a Kafka version without Zookeeper, but it’s not ready yet for production
  environments.
