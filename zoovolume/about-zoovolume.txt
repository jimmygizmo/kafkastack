This directory (/zoovolume/) is kept in the repository with the help of this about file.
The .gitignore file of this project will prevent any other contents of this directory
from being added to git.

This directory holds the data of the local instance of zookeeper, none of which should
be added to this repository.

UPDATE:
There is now a subdirectory mapped independently from inside zookeeper to outide and a disabled example of how
to do another subdir as well
These have placeholder files in them which keep the directories in git like this
about file does for its own directory. There are also corresponding .gitignore entries
to keep the individual contents out of the repository.

/zoovolume/data
/zoovolume/data/data-placeholder.txt

/zoovolume/foo
/zoovolume/foo/foo-placeholder.txt
