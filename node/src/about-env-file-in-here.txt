Just a quick test.

The dotenv module is a little weired somtimes and I felt like doing a quick test.
Now, in a container I would set env in other ways, but I just want to see a .env file
get picked up and used inside a container. It might give me ideas and I like to see dotenv working.
I've had too many times where dotenv was toublesome .. but I was probably doing something too fast
and did it wrong. Let's see how it does here.

UPDATE:
Glad I tested it. First try did not work.

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/.env'


----------------------------------
SOLUTION NOTED IN Dockerfile:
# Special tests with .env
# ** Dotenv could not find the .env file when it was getting put in /src/ next to the code!
# ** Maybe Dotenv always starts looking in the parent dir?! Maybe only if it is in a /src/ dir?!
# RESULT: IT WORKED! Conclusion: Carefully put the .env exactly in place and in the parent dir of a /src/
# or just generally in the parent dir of the source code calling dotenv loading. (I guess.)
COPY ./.env /app/
