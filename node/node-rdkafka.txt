I don't think this is the only node client lib I can use.
https://github.com/Blizzard/node-rdkafka

But it is linked to from the official Confluent site, so maybe it is the one to use ?!?
https://developer.confluent.io/get-started/nodejs/#create-project

This lib has instructions for special compiler settings for Mac, but of course the real
build for deployment will be done in the Node container.
Or maybe this will ONLY get built in the node container, so the Mac stuff is irrellevant.
I suppose there is some dev server (non-docker) approach but I'm not trying to do that right now.
